Your input will help us better understand the anime community and might even influence future anime productions. Please feel free to share your thoughts honestly. To start off, I'm curious about how often anime fits into your routine. Is it something you enjoy daily or perhaps it's more of a weekly treat for you? User: Daily. AI: That's awesome. Watching anime daily must mean it's a big part of your routine. It's great to have something you enjoy so much. Out of curiosity, when it comes to anime, is there a particular genre that really grabs your attention? Maybe something you always find yourself coming back to. User: Action. AI: Action. Got it.",
